ContentHash2Version

## Introduction | [ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡](/README_CN.md)

Since the output.chunkFilename of webpack cannot be used as a function, the resource version control cannot be completed under special circumstances, so the project was startedã€‚

If the following conditions exist, then using this tool to solve it is a feasible wayã€‚

* Need to add version number for each resource (js, css, images)
* Need to track changes in these resources

## How to implement this toolï¼Ÿ

Based on regular expressions, the original unstable contenthash is now replaced with a controllable version number.

The whole process looks like this:

1.  Existing default output

    ```
    # File
    css/chunk.qwe123.css
    js/chunk.asd123.js
    
    # Quote
    <link href=/css/chunk.qwe123.css>
    <script src="/js/chunk.asd123.js">
    # sourceMappingURL=chunk.asd123.js.map
    ```

2.  The output after modifying the webpack configuration
    ```
    # File
    css/chunk.qwe123.css
    js/chunk.asd123.js
    
    # Quote
    <link href=/css/chunk.qwe123.css?v=qwe12>
    <script src="/js/chunk.asd123.js?v=asd12">
    # sourceMappingURL=chunk.asd123.js.map?v=asd12
    ```

3.  Output after using the tool
    ```
    # File
    css/chunk.min.css
    js/chunk.min.js
    
    # Quote
    <link href=/css/chunk.min.css?v=8010>
    <script src="/js/chunk.min.js?v=8000">
    # sourceMappingURL=chunk.min.js.map?v=8000
    ```

**This tool only handles 2 to 3 steps, how to go from 1 to 2 step?**

Modify the webpack configuration of the project, like this, so is cssã€‚
```
config.output
      .chunkFilename('js/[name].[contenthash:10].js?v=[contenthash:8]')
      .filename('js/[name].[contenthash:10].js?v=[contenthash:8]')
```
